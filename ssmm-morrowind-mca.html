I've recently started modding Morrowind and grabbed just about every mod off the sidebar (thanks for compiling the list, /u/cml33 !) The problem I'm having with LGNPC is with the Secret Masters portion. It says I'm missing MCA.esm and it can't work without it, but I can't find that anywhere within the mod files. I used the link from the sidebar; is it outdated or did I miss something somewhere? Here's a screenshot of the Data Files menu with the issue. If any other information.

My favorite game of all time has been 100% revitalized. I stepped off of the boat in Seyda Neen and it was all new again, I've never been more in love with a podunk backwater town sinking into a bog. I plan on installing Tamriel Rebuilt next, but in the meantime can anyone recommend anymore great mods that are compatible with MGSO? I'm looking to maximize this rebirth process while still holding on to the core elements quick question. they all do the same thing. try to make NPC less static and less generic so which is best in your opinion, and why? cheers.  Version 6. and 7. of Neoptolemus' "Morrowind Comes Alive" use the heads and hairstyles from "Westly's Master Head Pack", which you don't need to have activated but you need to ensure you have its meshes and textures installed. Also, what's the version pf the MCA in the overhaul 3.0? I want a vibrant world, full of things. thanks. 
To be accepted as the leader of Zainab Camp, I need to bring a Telvanni lady for the Ashkhan Kaushad to marry. But the probelm is no telvanni people will accept to marry an ashlander. Day late with this one; my apologies. WIP changes to MCA companions to support real time traveling with player on boats, ships, sit striders and river striders. All I have going right now is the MGSO. I am looking for some lore friendly mods to add more challenging enemies, etc. to the game, and add some diversity tot he enemies. Also, anything that makes them harder overall is good too. Suggestions?

There's one that was for Oblivion that was pretty cool. More NPC's in towns would help make it less bland and empty. Every town I walk into it's like a ghost town. When I see Balmora, I should see like 15 NPC's just between the pawn broker and Ra'Virr the trader because why? It's a freaking market place! There should be people walking around and fruit stands and stuff. What about Vivec? Huge place but the outside is so empty. Thoe are just a few examples.

MCA or Morrowind Rebirth? - posted in Morrowind Mod Talk: Every time i reinstall Morrowind. I always get the MCA mod and the Undead mod by the same creator. Its a must have for me as i really like how i can see different npcs in towns and different enemies in ruins, tombs, wilderness in either. And am very excited! I've been trying to find my favorite mods again (but may have some on my old computer which is good since I've had issues), but can't figure out how to install mods on steam. Can anyone help (no need to up vote). I put in Morrowind Comes Alvie 5.3 (merging the leveled lists with Morrowind Advanced) and, sometime in Balmora I was attacked by thugs, the guards. I totally forgot to make a post here, but here comes, I am currently reviewing mods that make NPCs better in Morrowind. Right now, we are looking at npc additions but we'll then move on to mods that make npcs look better and finally mods that make them smarter.

I tried searching for posts about Morrowind Comes Alive, but it automatically ignores "Morrowind" in the search string, and that makes it a little unhelpful. Based on my understanding of how placing NPCs in the construction set works, I'd assume that mods that add npcs to towns such as MCA, would have issues with a mod that changes the town, such as morrowind rebirth. Does anyone. Do people still play this game? I've recently come back to Morrowind after a long hiatus (I do this every year or so), and thought I should finally get around to releasing the new version of MCA I started working on not long after I released. I am playing with a Morrowind Rebirth Are these mods compatible with it? The Undead LGNPC Graphic Herbalism (but a half of herbs open like containers) Rise of House Telvanni The Undead MCA - Morrowind Comes Alive Can you recommend more mods that are 100% percent compatible with my mod lists and that add new and interesting quests (maybe even smaller and not big quests lines), maybe some new weapons and mobs (to make the game more diverse).

I'm thinking about adding TR to my mod list, but I'm severely questioning the overall quality, as well as compatibility and performance.

I'm a longtime Morrowind player, but haven't done a playthrough in a few years. Regardless of what character I originally start as, I usually end up with strong melee combat, alchemy cheese, and killing everything in 2 hits with any of the strong artifact weapons, or even a looted Daedric sword. Any ideas for different playstyles that are fun and not too easy? One idea is to play a pure mage, with an alchemy-fixing mod. This could be fun as I haven't fully played through TR's Telvanni content. Reading the comments on there makes me 'definitely' not want to get it. So many people are running into problems with it, besides my laptop is on the verge of stuttering when running Morrowind. Hey folks, avid fan and modder here, coming back to see if I got a few more mods left in me and checking up on the state of TES:III. I'm doing yet another playthrough of this amazing game and thought I'd share some thoughts about how someone should write future mods or how some mods should be updated as OpenMW progresses into re-implementing systems and then extending them. These are thoughts I'm having to consider as I update my old mods and write some to be released sometime soon. Vvardenfell.

With MCA (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/6006) mod comes a plethora of new companions and a shitload of new problems lol. One of my companions got attacked by Bonewalker twice so he's bound to have some of his attributes lowered. I know the restoration spells on target do not exist in the whole game, but is it possible to create them (I made one - restore health on target, but it was long time ago so I forgot how to do it). Another problem is that my character is a theif/burglar/r. Adds 1200 NPCs to over 550 cells via leveled lists to bring Morrowind to life. All NPCs have random heads, hair, and equipment (so no two will look the same), and appear and disappear at random.
